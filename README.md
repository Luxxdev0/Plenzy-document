# More Updates Soon!!
As some of you may already know, Saika is another project by the same owners of Flooper. Unfortunately, they have a history of botting their servers and treating their developers..

While I don’t have direct proof it’s important to mention that Plenzy was caught skidding Beyond’s open-source launcher when Flooper was still active.

I strongly advise against joining these servers or supporting their projects. The only developer who has consistently avoided skidding and unethical practices is Sev.

I was once a developer on their team, but they keeped on spamming my DMs daily asking if my work was done—eventually This kind of toxic environment is why I walked away from OGFN at the time. But Please Do not Join servers Like this As they are skids And just a Min ago He blocked me for telling the truth As the server is botted He just said IG it is Or wtv So Just know GG there weird
